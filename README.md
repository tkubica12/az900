# AZ 900 workshop
This repo contains guide for my hands-on workshop on Azure Fundamentals. It is meant as notes for lecture, by itself is not self-explanatory - please follow our session.

# Theoretical part
I am covering theory during session, but as most of it can be learned by self-study I will dedicate 80% of our time to hands-on. To be well prepared for exam I recommend to run throw official training materials after our session.

You will find free online 6-part learning path here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900)

# Practical part
You have access to subscription we prepared beforehand (see [adminGuide.md](./adminGuide.md) if you are interested what steps we have done).

Notes for our labs today are available in [userGuide.md](./userGuide.md).
